Python COM System (short for Python Command System) is a command prompt
coded entirely in Python.

Requirements:
Python 3
A computer that meets the minimum requirements for MS Paint

Programs and Games:
Addition - Addition calculator
Car - A simple game where you can control a car
Division - Division Calculator
Jimothi99 - A "totally normal" chatbot
Multiplication - Multiplication calculator
Number to Power - A calculator that rounds a specified number to a specified power
Subtract - Subtraction calculator

All Commands:
add - opens the addition calculator
car - opens the car game
cd {directory name} - changes directory
copy {factors} - opens a prompt to copy a file from one location
to another (has required factors, see the section titled "Command factors")
countdown {seconds} - counts down a number of seconds specified
curdir - lists the current working directory
datetime now - shows the current date and time
del {filename} - deletes a specified file
dir - lists files in current directory
divide - opens the division calculator
gdrandid - prints a random Geometry Dash Level ID
Note: A lot of the IDs generated lead to levels which
don't exist anymore on the Geometry Dash servers.
install {package filename} - installs a package in .py format
(can be used to install updates and custom packages)
jimothi99 - opens the jimothi99 chatbot program
len {word} - prints the length of a word
move {filename} - opens a prompt to move a specified file from one
directory to another
mkdir {directory name} - makes a new directory with specified name
multiply - opens the multiplication calculator
numtopower - opens the program for raising a number to a specified power.
open pyfile {filename.py} - opens any specified Python file
readtxt {filename} - prints the text of a specified file
rmdir {directory name} - deletes an empty directory
rmtree {directory name} - deletes a specified directory and all contents
ping - replies with 'pong!'
quit - exits Python COM System
subtract - opens the subtraction calculator
systemtools - allows you to use system tools
writetxt {filename} - writes text to a file (also has optional factor(s),
see the section titled "Command factors")

Command factors:
copy {factors}
-f (makes a copy of a specified file)
(Also makes you type in a new name for copied file)
-f -d (copies a file from one directory to another)

writetxt {optional factor} {filename}
-r (replaces text in a file)
(normally, it doesn't let you write text to the file if it already exists)

Pro tips:
Type "help" followed by the name of a program to see
the program's commands!
Type "help 2" to see the next page of commands!
Type "help factors" for info about command factors!
Also, the only command in calculator programs is '!quit'
Type "cd .." to go back to the previous directory.

Known bugs:
If you are not in the same directory where "pycomsystem.py" is located or
in the "programs" directory of Python COM System, the built-in programs
will not open with their standard commands, and running their standard
commands in this case will cause Python COM System to crash. There is
probably no way to fix this, but if you are in the "programs" folder,
follow these steps:
1. Enter 'dir' into the command prompt to list all files
2. Enter "open pyfile {the name of the program you want to open.py}"
This will open the program.
Otherwise, you have to go back to the directory where "pycomsystem.py"
is located.

You can delete your Python COM System folder in Python COM System
by going to the folder's parent directory and although it will
definitely be broken, it still kinda runs.
